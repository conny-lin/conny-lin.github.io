Data science delivers the most impact when communicated in a way digestible for the decision-makers.

After immersing in research and industry data for more than 10 years, I ventured into the health policy realm for 2 years, where I find myself initiating data projects to improve, inform and communicate public policy. Clearly, data is still my core.

As a seasoned communicator who hosted TV interviews, delivered speeches to thousands and regularly interfaced with C-suites, I have both the soft and technical skills to help you harvest the most out of your data.
